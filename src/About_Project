     POM ===>
     I used Page Object Model(POM) pattern in to this project. It makes my project highly maintainable,
 reducing the code duplication and hiding the inner implementation from tests.

     for implement pom in tests, i create a page object class for each and every page that is being tested.

     For example:  i have Kayak.com home page. if i build a page object for home page, it will provide a method for
 bookflight, which will accept the user enter their information and take to user to the result page to get flight information.

      bookflightTests will instantiate the home page object and call the bookflight method.


PageFactory Class ===> extension to the POM design pattern. it is for initialize the elements of a page class
without having to use "findElement".
@FinBy can help us find the element,then inside the functional method i can call the webElement, and perform some actions.


      TestClass ---> where actually i write my test to use methods or web element from the home page, i have to just instantiate
home page, call my method in home page, provide user information which user use that for bookflight.



          Basic Structure ====>

    Pages
       HomePage
    Tests
       HomePageTests
    Utils
       BrowserUtils (contains reusable method which i use in my tests)
       Configuration_Reader
       Driver (singleton class )
       TestBase (contains before and after method )
    pom.xml (brain of my project, which contains--> dependensies,build information etc.)
    Configuration.properties (contains configuration information regarding my project. ex: url, browser, etc.)
